            <h4>Police Minister's Statement Injudicious and Vexatious, Says Wapunai</h4>
            <p>Approved for Release: Thursday 11 April, 2024</p>
            <p>SHADOW Minister for Police Hon. Johnson Wapunai has slammed his counterpart Minister for Police Hon.
              Peter Tsiamalili Jnr for a “completely inappropriate” statement he released yesterday alleging political
              coercion with the media, publicly putting a long serving police officer’s reputation in disrepute, and in
              general commenting on matters now before the court which borders on contempt and sub-judice commentary.
            </p>
            <p>Mr Wapunai stated that Mr Tsiamalili’s statement was a complete disgrace to his office and is contrary
              behaviour to that expected of a leader.</p>
            <p>Mr Johnson said: “Without stating the obvious, Mr Tsiamalili’s statement was clearly sub-judice and his
              specific remark that he trusts the Court to ‘expose any attempts to manipulate the justice system for
              political gain’ is tantamount to contempt on ongoing legal proceedings.</p>
            <p>“It is inappropriate for a supposed educated minister to talk about matters before the Court for
              deliberation, and he should know better not to instigate his own trial by media to seek public support for
              something that will be dealt with appropriately in due course.</p>
            <p>“It is unbecoming for a minister to suggest that this case is purely political, and is disrespectful to
              the alleged victims of Mr Manning’s previous actions and behaviour, which in essence is the basis of this
              case which is now before the National Court.”</p>
            <p>Mr Wapunai also noted that it was inappropriate for the Minister for Police to comment on matters
              concerning the Police Commissioner as he is not his spokesman and raises questions about personal
              collusion over professional conduct.</p>
            <p>He said that Mr Manning is more than capable to defend himself in Court without the minister’s two toea.
            </p>
            <p>Mr Wapunai said: “Additionally, it is completely unacceptable for the minister to suggest that the
              Opposition or I colluded with the media to somehow promote this case.</p>
            <p>“As far as I am concerned, the Post-Courier reported on the facts presented and gathered by the Court
              hearing, which was also covered by the National newspaper on page two of yesterday’s edition.</p>
            <p>“Both reports contained more or less the same information, with the only difference being the page
              numbers in which the story appeared — so I don’t know how exactly the minister finds it appropriate to
              suggest collusion between the media and the Opposition especially when the Court hearing is publicly held.
            </p>
            <p>“And how exactly was the matter sensationalised? The headline was "Manning to front court", that is true
              is it not? Yet another example of desperate tactics by the government to play victim and blame the media
              to shift the narrative.</p>
            <p>“Wasn’t it the Police Minister talking about the need to protect the integrity of the media and
              journalists through the Sensitive Investigation Board, yet here he is making desperate accusations against
              journalists and media houses?”</p>
            <p>Mr Wapunai also added that Mr Tsiamalili’s comments about the integrity of the plaintiff, Detective
              Senior Sergeant Tinol Pakiapon, was a new low point for the government.</p>
            <p>“Mr Tsiamalili is peddling his own allegations against Mr Pakiapon without any evidence or supporting
              documentation for these claims.</p>
            <p>“The Court will no doubt consider all these aspects relating to the case, and if there are any questions
              or concerns about the integrity of the plaintiff, Mr Manning is entitled to present his own evidence to
              support his case.</p>
            <p>“Mr Tsiamalili has no right to start a witch hunt against Mr Pakiapon simply because he is the plaintiff
              in this matter. The Court is the appropriate authority to decide whether or not there are merits to this
              matter and until all avenues are sufficiently exhausted to clear David Manning, I suggest Mr Tsiamalili
              refrain from vouching for a man currently in Court,” Mr Wapunai said.</p>
            <p>The shadow minister urged Mr Tsiamalili to be sensible in the statements he makes, apologise to the
              Post-Courier for making unfounded accusations against them, apologise to Detective Senior Sergeant Tinol
              Pakiapon for bringing his reputation into disrepute without any credible evidence or reason to in the
              first instance, and let the Court proceedings take its course without desperate efforts to interfere.</p>
            <p>“The minister’s disrespectful statement not only preempts issues before the Court, but is entirely
              misleading and defamatory in many aspects. I have asked my lawyers to assess the statement and advise me
              on possible legal action including citing him for possible contempt of Court.</p>
            <p>“Focus on your ministerial duties to improve the country’s law and order, you’re not David Manning’s
              lawyer or spokesman,” Wapunai told Tsiamalili.</p>

            <h4>Manning Must Make Lasting Impact on Law and Order</h4>
            <p>Press Statement for Immediate Release: 10 April 2024</p>
            <p>On behalf of the Opposition, Shadow Minister for Police Hon. Johnson Wapunai has acknowledged Police
              Commissioner David Manning on his re-appointment for another four years, however, has emphasised that Mr
              Manning must use his extended tenure to make a lifelong impact on the country’s police force and law and
              order situation.</p>
            <p>Mr Wapunai said: “I firstly congratulate Mr Manning for successfully completing his first term, part of
              which was consumed by his role as COVID-19 pandemic controller. In the history of the RPNGC, only a small
              number of commissioners have completed their full term, and even then, the number of reappointments are
              smaller.</p>
            <p>“While it is an achievement for Mr Manning to maintain his position, he must also realise the next four
              years will be crucial in fulfilling his duties and performing in a capacity many before him did not have.
            </p>
            <p>“In recent times and during the tenure of Mr Manning, we have seen kidnappings and attacks on foreigners,
              massacres with double digit death tolls, sophisticated transnational criminal elements peddling drugs,
              widespread election violence, and civil unrest leaving our country crippled.</p>
            <p>“It has truly been unprecedented times, and it is up to the capability of Mr Manning to curb these
              issues. He has witnessed these events firsthand so he should be taking active measures to ensure they
              never happen again.</p>
            <p>“By 2028, Mr Manning would have had a total of eight years as police commissioner. That is nearly a
              decade serving at the helm of the force – and if performed without fear or favour, with the country at
              heart, and servitude of the many and not few, he can institute a lot of change for the better.</p>
            <p>“I challenge Mr Manning to uphold the values and oath he made in his days as a recruit. He must uphold
              the true spirit and integrity of the law. As a two term police commissioner, he is now in a league of his
              own among his predecessors.</p>
            <p>“Many before him didn’t have the opportunity to serve full terms or twice, so it is incumbent upon him to
              do them proud with the opportunity he has.”</p>
            <p>Mr Wapunai urged Mr Manning to use the next four years to institute lasting impacts in the force that
              will set the bar for future commissioners and reminded him that there is no time to waste when it comes to
              the country’s security.</p>
            <p>“The Opposition cannot stress this enough: If we do not seriously address the terrible state of our
              internal security now, it will never improve and only get worse in the years to come.</p>
            <p>“The Opposition collectively calls for the improvement of criminal and fraud investigations, improve
              prosecution services by training officers to be professional and support them adequately, and do away with
              the Sensitive Investigations Board.</p>
            <p>“My message to Mr Manning is this: You have sworn your oath to God and country, not any political party
              or leader. Now that your tenure is ensured, I urge you to carry out your duties according to your oath and
              instigate change for the good of this nation,” Mr Wapuani said.</p>

            <h4>New Sensitive Investigations Board Raises Serious Questions</h4>
            <p>Press Statement for Immediate Release: 24 March 2024</p>
            <p>Shadow Minister for Police Hon. Johnson Wapunai has today cautioned the Police Commissioner and Minister
              for Police to seriously reconsider the establishment of the Sensitive Investigations Board until more
              information is known about its functions and administration.</p>
            <p>The Shadow Minister said the board raises a lot of serious questions about the special oversight given to
              high profile cases that often times face numerous impediments before prosecution.</p>
            <p>Mr Wapunai said: “The public needs more information on this new board before the Police Commissioner and
              his colleagues start scrutinising sensitive cases. With exclusive oversight over cases regarding
              politicians, statutory office holders and any other individuals the board may deem necessary, it raises
              the potential for unfair treatment and undue influence.</p>
            <p>“While Mr Manning’s statement appears well-intended, the reality is expected to be far different unless
              there is clear information given about this board.”</p>
            <p>Mr Wapunai also stated that while Mr Manning says the board intends at curbing opportunists from filing
              ‘dubious complaints’ for personal gain which ultimately get thrown out by court, that in itself is an
              admission that his rank and file are inadequate in performing investigations before pursuing cases.</p>
            <p>Mr Wapunai said: “If Mr Manning believes his officers are assisting opportunists pursue their agenda,
              this board does not fix that. It only cuts down on possible ‘dubious’ cases against office holders but not
              members of the general public. Mr Manning is effectively creating a VIP processing stream while everyday
              Papua New Guineans face normal police and judicial process.</p>
            <p>“By my understanding, if a police station receives a complaint from an individual or party, it is the
              duty of that particular police officer or unit who received it to investigate the complaint to
              substantiate whether an arrest and prosecution is warranted.</p>
            <p>“What Mr Manning is effectively saying is his police officers are colluding with individuals with vested
              interests to pursue matters of no substance that ultimately get thrown out of court. If this is the case,
              what is his solution in improving police investigations and ethics of officers, because this board
              shouldn’t be the only answer.</p>
            <p>“What gives the Police Commissioner and his board the right to decide guilt or innocence?</p>
            <p>“The timing of the establishment of this board is also questionable when we see a warrant of arrest for
              the Electoral Commissioner who is in hiding, an application for a warrant of arrest of David Manning by an
              experienced police officer, questions over the arrest of the Prime Minister over the Paraka saga, and
              other high-profile complaints that have been filed.”</p>
            <p>The Opposition have the following questions for Mr Manning:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>How often will this board meet?</li>
              <li>How diligent will the board be in deciding the fate of the various cases they have to deal with?</li>
              <li>If the board meets at their own discretion and convenience, and has various cases to deliberate over,
                will this result in backlogs and a delay in justice?</li>
              <li>What if the complaint concerns the Prime Minister, Minister of Police, or Police Commissioner? Will
                the board be unbiased?</li>
              <li>If there is a complaint about the Police Commissioner like there currently is, doesn’t this raise a
                conflict of interest with the whole board since Mr Manning is their colleague?</li>
              <li>Does this mean the current cases before the court or underway need to be reassessed by the board?</li>
              <li>What if a case that holds merit according to other agencies is denied by the board? What is the next
                course of action for the complainant?</li>
              <li>Does this mean that complaints and investigations by ICAC and the Ombudsman Commission will have to
                seek the endorsement of this board as well?</li>
              <li>What criteria and justifications will complaints or cases need to meet in order to be approved by the
                board?</li>
              <li>When does this board come into effect?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>“It is recommended that Mr Manning or the board refrains from making hasty decisions until these
              questions are answered, and for further transparency, Mr Manning should further explain this new board in
              detail to organisations like Transparency International, the Media Council, Ombudsman Commission, ICAC and
              the Department of Justice and Attorney-General for further input,” Mr Wapunai said.</p>
